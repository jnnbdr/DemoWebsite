                                        The package nbinteract aims to enable authors and educators to create and
                                        share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
                                        useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts.

CAUTION: Each interactive element presented on this page uses *time-consuming*
operations that take a while to finish. The elements are built through a
backend in the cloud. Please be patient to see the results.

First, let's introduce the video from _Mathologer_. This video creates very
nice patterns from _Times Tables_. Everybody knows them from primary school.
It's something like this:

.Table of *Two* (excerpt)
[cols="6a,6a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===
|Factor |Value

|`1 x 2`
|2

|`2 x 2`
|4

|`3 x 2`
|6

|`4 x 2`
|8

|===

The idea, in general, is surprisingly simple, but the results are surprising.
Please go for the video from _Mathologer_ first to catch the idea behind it.

In this document, several scenarios using _Times Tables_ as a base to
calculate plotted images are presented similar to the approach of
what _Mathologer_ is doing:

* a static but parametric version: you can change with sliders the values
  and experiment by yourself.
* an animated version to construct the image Line by Line: the factor
  and the number of points is fixed, but each line is plotted per iteration
* an animated version to construct the image Point by Point: the factor
  and the lines are fixed, but each iteration increases the number of points
* an animated version to construct the image Factor by Factor: the lines
  and the number of points is fixed, but the factor increases per iteration.
