                                        The package nbinteract aims to enable authors and educators to create and
                                        share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
                                        useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts.

CAUTION: Each interactive element presented on this page uses *time-consuming*
operations that take a while to finish. The elements are built through a
backend in the cloud. Please be patient to see the results.

An ordinary differential equation (often abbreviated to ODE) is one
Differential equation where only derivatives of the desired function
occur after exactly one variable. Many physical, chemical and biological
processes in nature are described mathematically with such equations.
Examples are the radioactive decay, motion processes of bodies, many types
of Oscillation processes or the growth behavior of animal populations.

In scientific models, ordinary differential equations are often used to
analyze, simulate, or be able to make predictions. Find an example below
describing the dynamics of the population of rabbits and foxes. Check how
the animals depend on each other. Manipulate some parameters to see the
influences on the rabbits and foxes population.
