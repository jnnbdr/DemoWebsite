CAUTION: Each interactive element presented on this page uses *time-consuming*
operations that take a while to finish. The elements are built through a
backend in the cloud. Please be patient to see the results.

The package *nbinteract* aims to enable authors and educators to create and
share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts. Consider these
explanations for linear regression and conditional probability, for example.

However, making an interactive web page often requires significant knowledge
of web technologies, especially Javascript. While Jupyter widgets allow authors
to generate interactive interfaces directly in a Jupyter notebook,
sharing these demos typically requires the readers to run the notebook. Th
 missing knowledge causes issues when the reader's computer lacks the correct
versions of the packages required to run the notebook completely.

The library `nbinteract` provides a single binary that converts Jupyter
notebooks into HTML pages. The resulting HTML pages can be shared with the
public, keeping any interactivity created using Jupyter widgets. For example,
the interactive parts of this website are entirely generated from notebooks
using `nbinteract`.

In addition, `nbinteract` provides a Python package. Once imported, the package
provides helper methods that allow users to create simple interactive
visualizations with single function calls.

[NOTE]
====
This document is a port for J1 Template of the original document pages
at link:{url-nbinteract--docs}[nbinteract Docs, {browser-window--new}].
Some sections are rewritten for the text to improve clarity and simplify the
language for future translation.

Meanwhile, a lot of changes were done for the services at
link:{url-binder--home}[Binder, {browser-window--new} ], which causes the
original pages doesn't work anymore. On clicking the NBI button `Show Widgets`,
you'll encounter that all interactive pages never change their state and
get stuck in `Initializing widgets...` for an infinite initializing loop.
====


== Getting Started

The following pages will show you how to use `nbinteract` and its related
tools. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a publicly accessible
interactive webpage to share with others!

The pages assumes familiarity with running terminal commands and using Jupyter
notebooks. The simplest way to follow this tutorial is to use the *Binder*
service to start a notebook server. On the next page, we'll guide you through
the steps to configure Binder so that the necessary packages are available for
use in notebooks.

=== Local installation

If you prefer to work with Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, you need
to install the `nbinteract` package on your PC. To install the package, run
the following commands in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
pip install nbinteract

# The next two commands can be skipped for notebook version 5.3 and above
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix bqplot
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
----

WARNING: To work locally, a full setup of a Python *language* versions
is required.

=== Setup steps

Enable interactive notebooks on webpages using `nbinteract` relies on the
*free* Binder service. To configure Binder to run your webpages, we will
create a GitHub repository that will allow you to host your converted webpages
publicly.

==== Creating a public repo at Github

To begin, visit https://github.com[Github, {browser-window--new}] and create
an account. If you already have an account, you should log in.

Then, create a new repo. You may do this using the GitHub UI or by visiting
https://github.com/new[create new repo at Github, {browser-window--new}]. Name
the repo *nbinteract-tutorial*. If you'd like a different name, feel free to
name it something else; keep in mind that we will use this repo name later in
the tutorial.

Make sure your repo is *public*, and click the checkbox to initialize your
repo with a README. Your page should look like this:

// image gh-repo-setup

Now, click on the Settings link for the repo near the top of the page, scroll
down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the main branch as the GitHub
pages source. Click the Save button to save your changes.

// image gh-pages-setup

Any file you upload to this repo will have a public URL. For example, the
README.md file in the repo has the following URL:

  {username}.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/README.md

Where `{username}` is replaced with your GitHub username. For example, if
my username is SamLau95, my URL is:

  SamLau95.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/README.md

If you can visit that URL and the page contains text (and not a 404 error),
you've set up your GitHub repo correctly.

==== Cloning your repo

Now, visit http://mybinder.org/[Binder] and paste the URL to your repo. It
should look like this:

  https://github.com/{username}/nbinteract-tutorial

Where {username} is replaced with your GitHub username.

Launch the Binder server to open Jupyter. If you are working locally, you
should instead run the following commands in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/{username}/nbinteract-tutorial

# Move into the repo directory
cd nbinteract-tutorial

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
----

=== Initializing nbinteract

Via the notebook interface, click on `New -> Terminal`. On clicking, this
should open a terminal prompt. Run the following commands:

[source, sh]
----
# Installs nbinteract
pip install nbinteract

# Initializes nbinteract. When prompted, create a requirements.txt file. Since we aren't
# adding additional packages in this tutorial, re-run the command to finish initialization.
nbinteract init

git add -A
git commit -m "Setup nbinteract"
git push origin main
----

The commands initialize the `nbinteract` package and push the configuration
files to GitHub. If you are working locally, skip the pip install command
above and run the remaining commands in your terminal.

textbook::nbi_docs_tutorial_interact[]

=== Publishing a Webpage

To convert a notebook into an HTML file, start a terminal and run the following command.

[source, sh]
----
  nbinteract tutorial.ipynb
----

The command generates a HTML file `tutorial.html` with the notebook's contents
created in the previous section. Now, push your files to GitHub by running:

[source, sh]
----
git add -A
git commit -m "Publish nb"
git push origin main
----

After pushing, you now have a URL you can view and share:

  {username}.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/tutorial.html

Where `{username}` is replaced with your GitHub username. For example, if
my username is SamLau95, my URL is:

  SamLau95.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/tutorial.html

==== Publishing to a different URL

To change the URL of the page you publish, you can rename your notebook
before you convert it. For example, if you rename `tutorial.ipynb` to
`hello.ipynb` and convert the notebook, the resulting URL becomes:

  {username}.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/hello.html

To change the path segment before the filename (nbinteract-tutorial), you
can create a new GitHub repo with the subpath name you want. Then, you may
create and convert notebooks in this repo. For example, if you create a new
repo called blog-posts and convert a notebook called tutorial.ipynb, the
resulting URL becomes:

  {username}.github.io/blog-posts/tutorial.html

==== Workflow

You have learned a simple workflow to create interactive webpages:

. write a Jupyter notebook containing Python functions
. use interact to create UI elements to interact with the functions.
. zun nbinteract {notebook} in a terminal to generate an interactive
  webpage using your notebook code.
. publish your webpage to GitHub pages to make it publicly accessible.

In the next section, you will create an interactive simulation of the
Monty Hall Problem. Onward!

textbook::nbi_docs_tutorial_monty_hall[]

== Recipes

The Recipes section shows in simple steps how to use `nbinteract`. In addition
to the classic widgets provided by Juypter Notebook, `nbinteract` offers
additional interactive elements.

=== Exporting with `nbinteract`

Installing the `nbinteract` package installs a command-line tool for
converting notebooks into HTML pages. For example, to convert a notebook
called `Hello.ipynb` using the Binder spec `calebs11/nbinteract-image/main`:

[source, sh]
----
# `main` is optional since it is the default
nbinteract Hello.ipynb -s calebs11/nbinteract-image
----

After running nbinteract init, you may omit the -s flag and simply write:

[source, sh]
----
nbinteract Hello.ipynb
----

One advantage of the command line tool is that it can convert notebooks in
folders as well as individual notebooks:

[source, sh]
----
# Using the -r flag tells nbinteract to recursively search for .ipynb files
# in nb_folder
nbinteract -r nb_folder/
----

For the complete set of options, run nbinteract --help.

[source, sh]
----
$ nbinteract --help
----

....
`nbinteract NOTEBOOKS ...` converts notebooks into HTML pages. Note that
running this command outside a GitHub project initialized with `nbinteract
init` requires you to specify the --spec SPEC option.

Arguments:
  NOTEBOOKS  List of notebooks or folders to convert. If folders are passed in,
             all the notebooks in each folder are converted. The resulting HTML
             files are created adjacent to their originating notebooks and will
             clobber existing files of the same name.

             By default, notebooks in subfolders will not be converted; use the
             --recursive flag to recursively convert notebooks in subfolders.

Options:
  -h --help                  Show this screen
  -s SPEC --spec SPEC        BinderHub spec for Jupyter image. Must be in the
                             format: `{username}/{repo}/{branch}`. For example:
                             'SamLau95/nbinteract-image/master'. This flag is
                             **required** unless a .nbinteract.json file exists
                             in the project root with the "spec" key. If branch
                             is not specified, default to `main`.
  -t TYPE --template TYPE    Specifies the type of HTML page to generate. Valid
                             types: full (standalone page), partial (embeddable
                             page with library), or plain (embeddable page
                             without JS).
                             [default: full]
  -B --no-top-button         If set, doesn't generate button at top of page.
  -r --recursive             Recursively convert notebooks in subdirectories.
  -o FOLDER --output=FOLDER  Outputs HTML files into FOLDER instead of
                             outputting files adjacent to their originating
                             notebooks. All files will be direct descendants of
                             the folder even if --recursive is set.
  -i FOLDER --images=FOLDER  Extracts images from HTML and writes into FOLDER
                             instead of encoding images in base64 in the HTML.
                             Requires -o option to be set as well.
  -e --execute               Executes the notebook before converting to HTML,
                             functioning like the equivalent flag for
                             nbconvert. Configure NbiExecutePreprocessor to
                             change conversion instead of the base
                             ExecutePreprocessor.
....

=== The method `nbi.publish()`

The `nbi.publish()` method can be run *inside* a Jupyter notebook cell.
It has the following signature:

[source, python]
----
import nbinteract as nbi

nbi.publish(spec, nb_name, template='full', save_first=True)
----

....
Converts nb_name to an HTML file. Preserves widget functionality.

Outputs a link to download HTML file after conversion if called in a
notebook environment.

Equivalent to running `nbinteract ${spec} ${nb_name}` on the command line.

Args:
    spec (str): BinderHub spec for Jupyter image. Must be in the format:
        `${username}/${repo}/${branch}`.

    nb_name (str): Complete name of the notebook file to convert. Can be a
        relative path (eg. './foo/test.ipynb').

    template (str): Template to use for conversion. Valid templates:

        - 'full': Outputs a complete standalone HTML page with default
          styling. Automatically loads the nbinteract JS library.
        - 'partial': Outputs an HTML partial that can be embedded in
          another page. Automatically loads the nbinteract JS library.
        - 'gitbook': Outputs an HTML partial used to embed in a Gitbook or
          other environments where the nbinteract JS library is already
          loaded.

    save_first (bool): If True, saves the currently opened notebook before
        converting nb_name. Used to ensure notebook is written to
        filesystem before starting conversion. Does nothing if not in a
        notebook environment.


Returns:
    None
....

For example, to convert a notebook called Hello.ipynb using the Binder spec
`calebs11/nbinteract-image/main`:

[source, sh]
----
nbi.publish('calebs11/nbinteract-image/main', 'Hello.ipynb')
----
