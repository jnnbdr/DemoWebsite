                                        The package nbinteract aims to enable authors and educators to create and
                                        share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
                                        useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts.

CAUTION: Each interactive element presented on this page uses *time-consuming*
operations that take a while to finish. The elements are built through a
backend in the cloud. Please be patient to see the results.

The Jupyter Project is a non-profit organization founded in 2014 by
_Fernando Perez_. The Jupyter project supports interactive scientific
Data evaluations and scientific calculations. The main applications provided
by the Jupyter Project are:

* Jupyter Notebook (JN)
* JupyterHub (JH)

NOTE: The name _Jupyter_ refers to the three main programming languages
_Julia_, _Python_ and _R_ supported by the Jupyter Notebook App. The
name _Jupyter_ is a homage to the notebook entries by _Galileo Galilei_
on the discovery of the moons of Jupiter, where he made his observations
and the measurement data together.

Jupyter Notebook (JN) is an open source web application that allows data
scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations,
and other multimedia resources. JN combines two components:

Web application::
a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine
explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.

Notebook documents::
a representation of all content visible in the web application, including
inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics,
images, and rich media representations of objects.

== Jupyter Basics

To understand this documentation better, below you find a brief description
of JupyterHub (JH) and the three base components of Jupyter Notebook (JN).

=== Jupyter Notebook App

The Jupyter Notebook *App* is a server-client application that allows editing
and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Notebook App can be
executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed
on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

=== Notebook documents

Notebook documents (or *notebooks* for short) are documents created by the
Notebook App, and both computer code (e.g., Python) and rich text may contain
elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc.). Notebook documents are
human-readable documents, alongside code descriptions and results (figures,
  tables, etc.).

=== Kernels

Generally, a notebook *kernel* is a *calculating machine* that lives in the
Jupyter Notebook App to process a Notebook document and executes its
code. The *Ipython* kernel, used for the NBI integration, runs _Python_
code, and produces the results.

=== JupyterHub

_JupyterHub_ (JH) brings the power of notebooks to *groups* of users. It
gives users access to computational environments and resources without
burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users can get
their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be
managed efficiently by system administrators without having the Jupyter
Notebook App (JN) locally installed on their systems.

JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on hardware hosted on your own and makes
it possible to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user.
It is customizable and scalable and is suitable for small and large teams,
academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure (for example like the
Binder service).

== Binder

Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be
shared and used by many remote users. A Binder service is powered by
link:{github-repo--binderhub}[BinderHub Repo on Github, {browser-window--new}],
an open-source tool that runs on Kubernetes, a portable, extensible,
open-source platform for managing containerized services. One such deployment
lives at link:{binder--home}[Binder Home, {browser-window--new}], and is free
to use.

== The Package nbInteract (NBI)

As a web technology, _Jupyter Notebook_ provides a platform for authoring
interactive scientific documents. For example, the popular `ipywidgets`
Python library allows users to create web-based user interfaces to interact
with arbitrary Python functions. Users can create these interfaces using
Python directly in the notebook instead of HTML and JavaScript, significantly
lowering the time needed to create these interfaces.

This ease of use encourages instructors and researchers to create interactive
explanations of their work. Unfortunately, it isn't easy to *share* these
interactive notebooks with the public. Sharing the notebook file itself
retains full interactivity but requires *viewers* to have Jupyter, Python,
and all other packages used in the notebook installed on their machines.

The freely available Binder service circumvents this by hosting notebook
servers pre-packaged with the necessary software. However, both of these
options still require readers to have prior familiarity with the Jupyter
environment, making them less suitable for use with non-technical people.

Authors can convert a Jupyter notebook to a static HTML document and host
the document as a publicly-accessible web page. However, this method does
not preserve the interactive elements of the notebook. The resulting web
page only contains text and images.

.NBI textbook (excerpt)
lightbox::nbi-textbook--excerpt[ 800, {data-nbi-textbook--excerpt}, role="mt-3 mb-4" ]
// image::pages/nbinteract/nbi-textbook-example.jpg["NBI textbook (excerpt)", 800]

The Python package `nbinteract` allows authors to convert Jupyter notebooks
into *interactive*, standalone HTML pages: the textbooks. The interactive
elements can use arbitrary Python code to generate output, including Python
libraries that use C extensions (e.g., _NumPy_ and _Pandas_) and libraries
that create images (e.g., _Matplotlib_).

Anyone with a modern web browser can use the resulting web pages even if
the viewer does *not* have Python or Jupyter installed on their computer.
To make this possible, NBI uses the freely available cloud service _Binder_.
Two communication libraries are used to interact with the _BinderHub_ and the
_JupyterHub_ services

You can find an overview of these services and their communication interfaces
at:

* link:{url-j1--binderhub}[BinderHub, {browser-window--new}]
* link:{url-j1--jupyterhub}[JupyterHub, {browser-window--new}]

TIP: The `nbinteract` package also includes additional methods for interactive
plots (widgets) designed for very fast interaction prototyping in the notebook
and smooth interaction on static HTML web pages.

== J1 NBI Integration

The integration of NBI consists of the following components:

* the (modified) JS and CSS files of the library *nbinteract-core* specified
  as resource record `nbinteract` (see: `~/_data/resources.yml`)
* an J1 adapter `nbinteract.js` for integration
* a module configuration `nbinteract.yml`
* an Asciidoc Extension `textbook::` to integrate textbooks (in webpages)

The built-in Starter Web of the template comes with a suitable J1 NBI
configuration and documents for testing. You can find examples of pages that
contain interactive textbooks under the menu `Lern` underneath the submenu
`Experimental|Textbooks`.

WARNING: To develop your *Jupyter Notebooks*, a *local* installation of the
*Python* programming language is required. For the development of Jupyter
Notebooks, the *Jupyter* package and the installation of the library
*nbinteract* are expected.

The module for J1 NBI integration is available as a stable version. However,
it is still in an experimental state. The main reason for that experimental
status is the *age* of the underlying library `nbinteract-core`.

NOTE: Recent library updates are more than a year ago, and the current
version of the Jupyter Notebook *JupyterLab* application, unfortunately,
*not* supported (yet).

=== Notebooks vs. Textbooks

Jupyter Notebook documents with the extension `.ipynb` are (data) files in
JSON format and can only be run using the *App* of Jupyter Notebook. On the
other hand, Textbooks are HTML exports with the extension `.html` from
Jupyter Notebooks to be viewed in a web browser.

For integrating textbooks in webpages, the notebooks with the extension
`.ipynb` are to be *exported* to HTML (text) files using the (Python)
program nbinteract. Textbooks that have already been exported can be found
for the *Starter Web* in the folder `~/pages/public/jupyter/notebooks/textbooks`.

== J1 NBI Configuration

The Template system J1 integrates the Javascript (core) library
`nbinteract-core.js` from NBI (nbinteract). The integration is a J1 module
that requires *no programming* to integrate interactive textbooks in
your webpages.

WARNING: The (core) library integrated with J1 can *only* used with the
Template System J1. The library `nbinteract-core` is modified for the use
with J1, allowing seamless integration between NBI and the pages of a J1 Web.

=== Modul configuration

As with all modules available with J1, *no programming* is required. An
adapter for the template system takes the necessary steps for integration,
so easy integration into your website is possible using the module
configuration.

the MatJax JS library may result in *strange outcomes* for other contents.
For that reason, the MathJax library should be used *carefully* for the
time being.

=== Binder configuration

The use of J1 NBI requires a valid Binder configuration. The binder
configuration is to be provided via a public Git repo. An example of such a
Git repo you find on Github at
link:{url-j1--gh-binder-repo}[J1 Binder Repo, {browser-window--new}].
The configuration settings are described in the <<Default settings>> section.

=== Textbook configuration

Besides the default settings for J1 NBI (`~/_data/default/nbinteract.yml`),
*individual* settings for each textbook (nbinteract HTML textebook) are
required to include textbooks in webpages. You find examples in the
configuration file `~/_data/nbinteract.yml`, a description of the parameters
used in the <<Textbook settings>> section.

=== Textbook integration

For integrating textbooks (nbinteract HTML notebook) into web pages, the
resource of J1 NBI Module is required. The `ID` of the module of the J1 NBI
integration is: `nbinteract`.

Once the configuration steps for using J1 NBI have been completed, integrating
textbooks is very easy. The Asciidoc extension `textbook::` can include a
textbook (nbinteract HTML Notebook) anywhere.

== NBI Textbook examples

For the J1 template, textbooks are typically integrated as *dynamic* HTML
pages. In addition to the dynamic pages, textbooks can also be integrated as
*static* HTML code. You can find examples for both variants in the following
sections.

=== Static Textbook

The `nbconvert` tool converts *Jupyter Notebooks* to various other formats via
Jinja templates. The tool allows you to convert an .ipynb notebook file into
various *static* formats. For more details, refer to
link:{url-nbconvert--doc}[nbconvert - usage, {browser-window--new}].

=== Interactive Textbook

*Interactive* Textbooks are generated using `nbinteract`:

=== Conclusion
