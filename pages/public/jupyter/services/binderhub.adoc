Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be
shared and used by many remote users. You can use many open source languages,
<<Configure the user interface>>, and more. A Binder service is powered by
link:{github-repo--binderhub}[BinderHub Repo on Github, {browser-window--new}],
an open-source tool that runs on Kubernetes, a portable, extensible,
open-source platform for managing containerized services. One such deployment
lives at link:{binder--home}[Binder Home, {browser-window--new}], and is free
to use.

== Configuration Files

The `repo2docker` CLI looks for configuration files in the repository being
built to determine how to build it. In general, repo2docker uses the same
configuration files as other software installation tools, rather than
creating new custom configuration files. A number of repo2docker configuration
files can be combined to compose more complex setups.

The https://github.com/binder-examples[binder examples, {browser-window--new}]
organization on GitHub contains a list of sample repositories for common
configurations that repo2docker can build with various configuration files
such as Python and R installation in a repository.

Binder examples:

* https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo[JupyterLab Demonstration, {browser-window--new}]
* https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab[JupyterLab + Binder, {browser-window--new}]
// * https://github.com/binder-examples/remote_storage[Remote Storage with Binder, {browser-window--new}]
* https://github.com/binder-examples/python-conda_pip[Using conda with pip in the same build, {browser-window--new}]
* https://github.com/binder-examples/pipfile[Python environment with Pipfile, {browser-window--new}]

A list of supported
configuration files (roughly in the order of build priority) can be found
below.

=== environment.yml

The `environment.yml` configuration is the standard configuration file used
by *Conda* that lets you install any kind of package, including Python, R,
and C/C++ packages. The `repo2docker` does *not* use your environment.yml
to create and activate a new conda environment. Rather, it updates a base
conda environment defined here with the packages listed in your
`environment.yml`. This means that the environment will always have the
same default name, not the name specified in your `environment.yml`.

[source, yaml]
----
dependencies:
  - ipywidgets
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - statsmodels
----

If you use `environment.yml`, then Binder will use a *Miniconda* distribution
to install your packages. However, you may still want to use *pip*. In this
case, you should *not* use a `requirements.txt` file, but instead use a pip
*section* in `environment.yml`. This repository is an example of how to
construct your configuration to accomplish this.

[source, yaml]
----
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python
  - numpy
  - pip
  - pip:
    - nbgitpuller
    - sphinx-gallery
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
----

=== requirements.txt

This configuration specifies a list of *Python packages* that should be
installed in your environment. Our requirements.txt example on GitHub shows
a typical requirements file.

For Binder, the requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries that
your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:

[source, sh, role="noclip"]
----
  pip install -r requirements.txt
----

The base Binder image contains *no extra* dependencies, so be as explicit
as possible in defining the packages that you need. This includes specifying
explicit versions wherever possible.

WARNING: If you do specify *strict versions*, it is important to do so
for all your dependencies, not just direct dependencies. Strictly specifying
only some dependencies is a recipe for environments breaking over time.

You can also specify which Python *version* to install in your built
environment with `environment.yml`. By default, repo2docker installs
*default_python* (Python 3.7) with your `environment.yml` unless you
include the version of Python in this file. The package manager *conda*
supports all versions of Python, though repo2docker support is best with
Python `3.7`, `3.6`, `3.5` and `2.7`.

WARNING: If you include a Python version in a `runtime.txt` file in
*addition* to your `environment.yml`, your `runtime.txt` will be
*ignored*.

=== runtime.txt

Sometimes you want to specify the *version* of the runtime (e.g. the version
of Python), but the environment specification format will not let you
specify this information (e.g. requirements.txt). For these cases, we have a
special file, runtime.txt.

NOTE: runtime.txt is only supported when used with environment specifications
that do not already support specifying the runtime. If using environment.yml
for conda, runtime.txt will be ignored.


== Configure the user interface

You can build several user interfaces into the resulting Docker image. This
is controlled with various <<Configuration Files>>.

=== JupyterLab Interface

JupyterLab is the *default* interface for repo2docker. The following
Binder URL will open the *jekyll-one* repository and begin a JupyterLab
session opening the path `notebooks`:

[source, txt]
----
  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jekyll-one/j1-binder-repo/main?filepath=notebooks
----

The filepath notebooks above is how JupyterLab directs you to a specific file
or folder. To learn more about URLs in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook, visit
link:{jupyterlab-docs--getting-started}[Starting JupyterLab, {browser-window--new}].

=== Classic Notebook Interface

The classic notebook is also available without any configuration. To switch
to the classic notebook interface, you do not need any extra configuration
in order to allow the use of the classic notebook interface. You can launch
the classic notebook interface from within a user session by opening
JupyterLab and replacing the path `/lab/` with `/tree/` in the JuptyerLab URL
like so:

----
  https://mybinder.org/v2/<repo-provider>/<repo>/<branch>?urlpath=/tree
----

.Example
[source, txt]
----
  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jekyll-one/j1-binder-repo/main?urlpath=/tree
----


/////
=== nteract

nteract is a notebook interface built with *React*. It is similar to a
more feature-filled version of the traditional Jupyter Notebook interface.
*nteract* comes pre-installed in any session that has been built from a
Python repository.

You can launch nteract from within a user session by replacing `/tree` with
`/nteract` at the end of a notebook server’s URL like so:

  http(s)://<server:port>/nteract

For example, the following Binder URL will open the pyTudes repository and
begin an nteract session in the ipynb folder:

  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norvig/pytudes/HEAD?urlpath=nteract/tree/ipynb

The `/tree/ipynb` above is how nteract directs you to a specific file
or folder. To learn more about nteract, visit the
https://nteract.io/about[nteract website, {browser-window--new}].


=== Use different repositories for content and environment

// See: https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/external_binder_setup.html

Separating your Binder setup files from your repository content can be
useful for a variety of reasons. Maybe they need different access permissions
or you manage your working environment external to your code repository.
Whatever the reason, with a custom Binder URL you can store your environment
independent of your content.

The form on the mybinder.org home page only allows you to select a repository
branch to build from. To create a BinderHub deployment link for situations
where the environment and content are housed in separate repositories or on
different branches of the same repository, you can use the
https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link?tab=binder[nbgitpuller link generator, {browser-window--new}]
to generate a formatted URL. Note that `nbgitpuller` must be included in your
hub environment for this to work.

For some background on this how-to guide, see this
https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/improve-documentation-for-new-users-not-working-on-the-master-branch/5509[community forum post, {browser-window--new}].
Here is an example repository using a JupyterHub environment configuration
stored in a https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/jupyter-image-2020[separate repository, {browser-window--new}].
The environment was set up for a community workshop and the tutorial content
was compiled and released after the workshop.
/////

// === Speed up repository launch time
//
// People often ask how they can speed up the launches for their Binder
// repositories. Binder is a bit different from other cloud services because
// it builds and launches arbitrary environments that are defined in Git
// repositories, rather than only serving a single environment for launches.
// The extra time it takes to launch is often a result of these extra steps.
//
// For some background and tips about how you can speed up your repository
// launch times, see this
// link:{jupyter-discourse--startup-time}[community forum post, {browser-window--new}].

=== Track repository data on Binder

The mybinder.org team runs a service that provides repository-level data
about all of the binders that run each day. This is called the mybinder.org
event analytics archive. You can use this to track how often people are
clicking your Binder links and launching your Binder repository (or, for
aggregating activity across many repositories).

=== Access the event analytics archive

You can access the event analytics archive at `archive.analytics.mybinder.org`.
For information about the structure of this dataset, and a description of
how you can read-in the data in order to analyze it, see the
link:{binder-sre--analytics}[Binder Site Reliability Guide (SRE), {browser-window--new}].
instructions.

==== Example repository to show off analyses

To give you a little inspiration, check out the
link:{binder--binderlyzer}[binderlyzer binder, {browser-window--new}].
This is a Binder that goes through a simple analysis of Binder repositories
using the events archive. It shows how to access it, and gives an idea for
questions you can ask with this data!

If you do something interesting or fun with the event analytics archive,
please let us know! We provide this resource in the hopes that it gives
people insight into the activity going on in Binder land, and would love
to hear about anything interesting you find.


== Binder API Reference

// https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/index.html

BinderHub connects several services together to provide on-the-fly
creation and registry of Docker images. It utilizes the following
tools:

* A cloud provider such Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2,
  and others
* Kubernetes to manage resources on the cloud
* Helm to configure and control Kubernetes
* Docker to use containers that standardize computing environments
* A BinderHub UI that users can access to specify Git repos they want built
  repo2docker to generate Docker images using the URL of a Git repository
* A Docker registry (such as gcr.io) that hosts container images
* JupyterHub to deploy temporary containers for users

After a user clicks a Binder link, the following chain of events happens:

. BinderHub resolves the link to the repository.
. BinderHub determines whether a Docker image already exists for the
  repository at the latest ref (git commit hash, branch, or tag).
. If the image *doesn’t* exist, BinderHub creates a build pod that uses
  repo2docker to do the following:

  ..  Fetch the repository associated with the link
  ..  Build a Docker container image containing the *environment*
      specified in configuration files in the repository.
  ..  Push that image to a *Docker registry*, and send the registry
      information to the BinderHub for future reference.

. BinderHub sends the Docker image registry to *JupyterHub*.
. JupyterHub creates a *Kubernetes pod* for the user that serves
  the *built* Docker image for the repository.
. JupyterHub *monitors* the user’s pod for activity, and *destroys*
  it after a short period of inactivity.

// See: https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/kubernetes-pods.html
//
NOTE: *Pods* (smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed,
and managed in Kubernetes) are the rough equivalent of a machine instance
(physical or virtual) to a container. Each pod is allocated its own internal
IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and containers within
pods can share their local storage and networking.

.Binderhub Architecture
lightbox::binderhub--architecture[ 800, {data-binderhub--architecture}, role="mt-3 mb-4" ]


=== API Endpoint

There’s one API endpoint, which is:

[source, text]
----
  /build/<provider_prefix>/<spec>
----

Even though it says build it actually performs launch.

* provider_prefix identifies the provider
* spec defines the source of the computing environment to be built
  and served using the given provider.

NOTE: The provider_prefix can be any of the supported repository providers
in BinderHub, see the Repository Providers section for supported inputs.

To use this endpoint, construct an appropriate URL and send a request.
You’ll get back an Event Stream. It’s pretty much just a long-lived HTTP
connection with a well known JSON based data protocol. It’s one-way
communication only (server to client) and is straightforward to implement
across multiple languages.

When the request is received, the following happens:

. Check if this image exists in our cached image registry. If so,
  launch it.
. If it doesn’t exist in the image registry, we check if a build
  is currently running. If it is, we attach to it and start streaming
  logs from it to the user.
. If there is no build in progress, we start a build and start streaming
  logs from it to the user.
. If the build succeeds, we contact the JupyterHub API and start launching
  the server.

=== Events

This section catalogs the different events you might receive.

.Events
[cols="2,4a,6a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===
|Event |Response |Description

|*Failed*
|`{"phase": "failed", "message": "Reason"}`
|Emitted whenever a build or launch fails. You must *close* your
*EventStream* when you receive this event.

|*Built*
|`{"phase": "built", "message": "Human readable message", "imageName": "Full name of the image that is in the cached docker registry"}`
|Emitted after the image has been built, before launching begins.
This is emitted in the start if the image has been found in the cache
registry, or after build completes successfully if we had to do a build.

Note that clients shouldn’t rely on the imageName field for anything
specific. It should be considered an internal implementation detail.

|*Waiting*
|`{"phase": "waiting", "message": "Human readable message"}`
|Emitted when we started a build pod and are waiting for it to start.

|*Building*
|`{"phase": "building", "message": "Log message"}`
|Emitted during the actual building process. Direct stream of logs
from the build pod from *repo2docker*, in the same form as logs from
a normal *docker build*.


|`Fetching`
|`{"phase": "fetching", "message": "log messages from fetching process"}`
|Emitted when fetching the repository to be built from its source (GitHub, GitLab, wherever).

|*Pushing*
|`{"phase": "pushing", "message": "Human readable message", "progress": {"layer1":  {"current": <bytes-pushed>, "total": <full-bytes>}, "layer2": {"current": <bytes-pushed>, "total": <full-bytes>}, "layer3": "Pushed", "layer4": "Layer already exists"}}`
|Emitted when the image is being pushed to the cache registry. This
provides structured status info that could be in a progressbar. It’s
structured similar to the output of *docker push*.

|*Launching*
|`{"phase": "launching", "message": "user friendly message"}`
|When the repo has been built, and we’re in the process of waiting
for the hub to launch. This could end up succeeding and emitting a
*ready* event or failing and emitting a *failed* event.

|*Ready*
|`{"phase": "ready", "message": "Human readable message", "url": "full-url-of-notebook-server", "token": "notebook-server-token"}`
|When your notebook is ready! You get a endpoint URL and a token
used to access it. You can access the notebook\|API by using the
token in one of the ways the notebook accepts security tokens.

|===

=== Heartbeat

In EventSource, all lines beginning with `:` are considered comments.
We send a `:heartbeat` every 30s to make sure that we can pass through
proxies without our request being killed.

=== Repository Providers

Repository Providers (or RepoProviders) are locations where repositories
are stored (e.g., GitHub). BinderHub supports a number of providers out
of the box, and can be extended to support new providers. For a complete
listing of the provider classes, see table below.

.Provider
