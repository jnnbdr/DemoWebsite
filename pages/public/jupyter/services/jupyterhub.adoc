JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users
access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users
with installation and maintenance tasks. Users, including students, researchers,
and data scientists, can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared
resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.

JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible
to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user in the world.
It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams,
academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure.

== Services API

Javascript client for the Jupyter services REST APIs. All functions and
classes using the REST API allow a serverSettings parameter to configure
requests. Requests are made using the fetch API, which is available in
modern browsers or via npm install fetch for node users. The whatwg-fetch
npm package can be used to polyfill browsers that do not support the
fetch API.

This package introduces a number of concepts, such as session context, etc.
Here we give a brief overview of some of the top-level concepts in this
package.

=== Clients

A client is a single entity connected to a kernel. Since kernel messages
include the client id, it is easy for a client to filter kernel messages for
just messages between it and the kernel. In JupyterLab, different activities,
such as a console and a notebook, are usually considered separate clients
when connected to the same kernel.

=== Kernel specs

A kernel spec is the data about an available kernel on the system. We can
retrieve a current list of kernel specs from the server.

=== Kernels

A kernel represents a running process on the server that implements the
Jupyter kernel messaging protocol.

=== Kernel model

A kernel model mirrors the server kernel models, and represents a single
running kernel on the server. A kernel can be created, restarted, shut down,
etc., through calls to the server. A kernel model's lifecycle mirrors the
server kernel model's lifecycle, and it will be disposed when the server
kernel is shut down.

=== Kernel connection

A kernel connection represents a single client connecting to a kernel over
a websocket (wss). Typically only one kernel connection handles comms for any
given kernel. The kernel connection is disposed when the client no longer
has a need for the connection. Disposing a kernel connection does not cause
the kernel to shut down. However, if a kernel is shut down, (eventually)
all of its kernel connections should be disposed if they were initiated
from a kernel manager. If the kernel connections were instantiated outside
of a manager, you are responsible for cleaning them up.

A kernel connection has a number of signals, such as kernel status,
kernel connection status, etc.

=== Kernel manager

A kernel manager is an object that maintains a list of kernel models by
regular polling. The kernel manager can instantiate a kernel connection
and will manage its lifecycle.E.g., when the kernel is shut down, the
connections will be disposed.

The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around kernels and their
connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with kernels on a server
through a manager.

=== Sessions

A session is a mapping on the server from an identifying string (the
session's path) to a kernel. A session has a few other pieces of information
to allow for easy categorization and searching of sessions.

The primary usecase of a session is to enable persisting a connection to a
kernel. For example, a notebook viewer may start a session with session path
of the notebook's file path. When a browser is refreshed, the notebook viewer
can connect to the same kernel by asking the server for the session
corresponding with the notebook file path.

=== Session model

A session model mirrors a server session. The session models can be refreshed
from the server, created, changed (including creating a new session kernel),
and shut down (which implies that the kernel will be shut down). A session
model's lifecycle mirrors the server session's lifecycle, and it will be
disposed when the server session is shut down.

=== Session connection

A session connection represents a single client connected to a session's
kernel. A session's kernel connection can change and may be null to signify
no current kernel connection. A session connection owns the kernel connection,
meaning the kernel connection is created and disposed by the session
connection as needed. The session connection proxies signals from the kernel
connection for convenience. E.g. you can listen to the session's status
signal to get status changes for whatever the current kernel is, without
having to disconnect and reconnect your signal handlers every time the session
kernel changes.

The session connection can be disposed when the client no longer is connected
to that session's kernel, and disposal will not cause the session model to be
deleted.

=== Session manager

A session manager is an object that maintains a list of session models by
regular polling. The session manager can instantiate a session connection
and will manage its lifecycle. E.g. when the session is shut down, the
connections will be disposed.

The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around sessions and their
connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with sessions on a server
through a manager.

=== Session Context

A session context is an object which has the same lifecycle as the client.
The session context owns a session connection, which may be null if the
client is not currently associated with a session. The session context
proxies the current session connection's signals for convenience. The
session context primarily serves as a stable object for a client to keep
track of the current session connection. The session context also contains
some convenience functionality, such as preferences for whether a kernel
should be started and a user-friendly kernel name and status.
